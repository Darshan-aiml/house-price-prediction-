House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to accurately predict house prices based on a variety of features. The goal is to analyze the dataset, perform feature engineering, and train a robust regression model that can provide reliable price estimates.

Project Goal

The primary objective is to build a high-performance regression model that can predict the sale price of a house. This involves a complete data science workflow, from initial data exploration and cleaning to model training, evaluation, and interpretation. The final model provides valuable insights into the key factors that drive property values.

Methodology

The project followed a structured machine learning workflow:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The dataset was thoroughly analyzed to understand the distribution of variables and their relationships with the target variable (SalePrice).

Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify trends, correlations, and potential outliers in the data.

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:

Handled missing values and converted categorical features into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

Created new features from existing ones to improve the model's predictive power.

Applied scaling to numerical features to ensure all variables were on a comparable scale.

Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and handle multicollinearity.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Multiple regression algorithms were trained and evaluated, including a baseline Linear Regression model and a more advanced Gradient Boosting Regressor.

The models were trained on a dedicated training set and evaluated on an unseen test set to ensure unbiased performance assessment.

The primary metric for evaluation was the R-squared (R²) score, which measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

Results & Impact

The final Gradient Boosting Regressor model demonstrated exceptional performance and significantly outperformed the baseline models.

High Accuracy: The model achieved an R-squared (R²) value of 0.92 on the test set, indicating that it can explain 92% of the variability in house prices.

Significant Improvement: This result represented a 26% improvement in predictive accuracy over the baseline linear regression model (which scored 0.73).

Actionable Insights: The model's feature importance analysis revealed the most significant factors influencing property values, providing valuable, data-driven insights for real estate analysis.
